# Tigre Word Count

[Tigre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigre_language) is a language primarily spoken by the Tigre people in Eritrea.


This repo contains a compilation of `0.25 million` unique Tigre words with their occurence frequencies.

The source documents were collected mainly from [`Eritrea Haddas`](https://shabait.com) newspaper, books, and web articles.

The vocabulary is expected to grow further as more text becomes available for analysis, and this repository will be updated, accordingly.
